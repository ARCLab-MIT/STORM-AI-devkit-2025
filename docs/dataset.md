# Dataset Information

## STORM-AI Dataset

The Satellite Tracking and Orbit Resilience Modeling with AI (STORM-AI) Dataset comprises of a public challenge and private evaluation dataset.

<b>The full public schallenge problem dataset will be made available to participants when the competition phase begins on December 16, 2024.</b>

### Warmup Dataset 

The <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/nz1j92xpr6eet3fa5mx5i/ADMYs2zfr3dvxJ-FFd5dmM8?rlkey=tem27v1d2raf2nnlcq6cd49ev&st=sty6ggo3&dl=0)">Warm-Up Dataset</a> for participants was released on November 15, 2024. 

Participants should use this subset of the STORM-AI data to become familiar with the phenomenology and formats they will be asked to use during Phase 1 of the competition. The warmup dataset consists of: 
* <b>OMNI2_112613_012420.csv</b>: Space weather information, collected by NASA Space Flight Goddard Center 
* <b>g13_112613_012420.csv</b>: X-Ray flux information, collected by NOAA'S GOES-13 satellite 
* <b>SWARMA_DNS_POD_0012414_012420.csv</b>: Time series orbit average density values collected by ESA'S SWARM A satellite
* <b>SWARMA_POD_RN_0012414_012420.csv</b>: Positions and orbit parameters for ESA's SWARM A satellite

Your objective is to design a model that, given a spacecraft's initial state and 60 days of space weather and X-Ray flux information directly preceding that state, can predict the next 3 days of atmospheric density values the spacecraft will observe.

That is, your model should take in three kinds of inputs: 
* A satellite's initial location, provided in both geodetic coordinates and orbital elements
* Space weather information for the 60 day period preceding the timestamp of the initial satellite location
* X-Ray flux information for the 60 day period preceding the timestamp of the initial satellite location

Your model should then predict the sequence of orbit-averaged atmospheric density values that the spacecraft will observe in the future. This prediction must span a period of 3 days directly following the timestamp of the initial satellite location. 

Therefore, the timestamps in the space weather (OMNI2) and X-Ray flux (G13) information CSV files begin 60 days prior to the timestamps of the orbits and densities in the SWARM A data files, and the last timestamp in the SWARM A data files is 3 days past the last timestamp in the OMNI2 and G13 data. 

Some recommendations: 
* You may take the 63-day 'test-case' cycle from anywhere in the provided warmup data files to get familiar with the objective of the competition. 
* We recommend reviewing the Challenge Dataset Description below for more details on the challenge and warmup dataset. This includes exploring the column headers and data type descriptions. 
* Be mindful of dataset units and representations! The warmup data should help get you in this mindset.

### Challenge Dataset Description

The STORM-AI dataset consists of a public challenge dataset and a private evaluation dataset. The public challenge dataset contains astrometric and space weather data that can be used to train and validate AI algorithms.

#### Astrometric Data
The astrometric data contains the measured atmospheric density along the trajectories of multiple satellites, each of the satellites operating with different mission objectives and equipped with different propulsion capabilities. The data is provided at a minimum 1-hour temporal resolution, and consists of the orbital elements, geographic positions, and atmospheric density measures of satellites. The figure below shows a snapshot of example challenge data for a single satellite.

The [warmup dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5pq4kens2baw71p6pr1aq/AFD4xBI92ZN5CHy1cDlJp1E?rlkey=me1bztt2pmitz8w7ss825scs1&st=jsy8omrb&dl=0) includes an example subsection of this space weather data collected from NASA's OMNI2 satellite, from November 26, 2013 to January 24, 2020.

### Evaluation Dataset 
The private evaluation dataset contains additional data that will be used to evaluate the performance of the participants' models. This private evaluation dataset consists of the trajectories and atmospheric density values of satellites not included in the public challenge dataset.

## Guidelines

Participants should note that algorithm inputs must be limited to the phenomenology and data formats present in the public training dataset, but utilizing additional phenomenology or data sources for model validation and development is allowed and encouraged. 

Also note that since these datasets are collected from real spacecraft, there may be short gaps in the data due to blackout periods and instrument error. Participants should take this into account when designing their algorithms to ensure successful submissions.
