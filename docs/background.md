# Background

Here we present some of the approaches developed in previous work to improve upon existing atmospheric density models. While prediction capabilities are not built into empirical models like NRLMSIS, developing that capability is essential for satellite orbit propagation, drag estimation, and collision avoidance, thereby enhancing the safety and efficiency of space operations. These newly-developed models utilize solar and geomagnetic indices, such as solar flux and geomagnetic activity, along with temporal features derived from sliding windows that capture historical and contextual patterns, and by leveraging advanced architectures like transformers and reduced-order models (ROM), they learn the intricate relationships between solar and geomagnetic activities and their impact on atmospheric density. Once trained, they generate global grids of atmospheric density at various altitudes and locations and can even be used to forecast future atmospheric conditions. 

This approach forms the foundation of this challenge but is not the exact task participants are required to perform. What this work does provide participants is valuable context and insight into how space weather data are used to develop generalizable approaches to deriving atmospheric density. It is a prime example of how AI solutions can further space weather research and safer, more sustainable space operations, and for those new to the field, we hope that this work can provide a solid starting point for iterative improvements and experimentation with newer AI techniques. We encourage you to explore [the model this competition is inspired by](https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/2025-aichallenge-devkit/tree/main/background_model) to gain a deeper understanding of the atmospheric density forecasting problem.

If you would like to use this methodology to begin experimenting with the warmup dataset, you can generate atmospheric density information as follows: NRLMSIS 2.0, an empirical atmospheric density model, requires satellite time, altitude, longitude, latitude, and two additional space weather parameters: F10.7 solar flux and Ap geomagnetic index. These parameters are sourced from NASA's historical [OMNI dataset](https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The [pymsis](https://pypi.org/project/pymsis/) package is then used to generate atmospheric density values along an expected satellite orbit.
